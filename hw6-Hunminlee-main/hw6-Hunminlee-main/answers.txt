1. What does the corresponding adjacency list look like? Be sure to follow
the format from README.md. We have provided a template to get you started.

== START LIST ==
0: [(5, 2)]
1: [(2, 14), (5, 13), (6, 15)]
2: [(1, 14), (3, 11), (4, 4), (5, 10), (6, 8)]
3: [(2, 11), (5, 2)]
4: [(2, 4), (5, 3)]
5: [(0, 2), (1, 13), (2, 10), (3, 2), (4, 3), (6, 6)]
6: [(1, 15), (2, 8), (5, 6)]

2. Your graph drawing should be in "graph.png"

3. List out how dist changes as run Dijkstra's on your graph. The first row
should be the initialization. The second row should be setting the source to 0.
Each new row afterwards represents what dist looks like after examining a
neighbor. We have provided a template to get you started.

== START DIST ==
[inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf] 
[0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf] 
[0, inf, inf, inf, inf, 2, inf]  //0-5

[0, 15, inf, inf, inf, 2, inf]   //5-1

[0, 15, 12, 4, inf, 2, inf]      //5-3
[0, 15, 12, 4, 5, 2, inf]        //5-4

4. List out how prev changes as run Dijkstra's on your graph. The first row
should be the initialization.  Each new row afterwards represents what dist
looks like after examining a neighbor. We have provided a template to get you
started.
